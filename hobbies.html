    <h1>I'll get my kit!</h1>
<p>I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.</p>
<p>Kif might! Daylight and everything. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Who said that? SURE you can die! <strong> You want to die?!</strong> <em> I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.</em> 8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</p>
<h2>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</h2>
<p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Oh God, what have I done?</li><li>I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</li><li>Also Zoidberg.</li>
</ol>

<h3>I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.</h3>
<p>No argument here. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Now what?</p>
<ul>
<li>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</li><li>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</li><li>Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. That's not soon enough! We don't have a brig. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Belligerent and numerous. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
<p>Negative, bossy meat creature! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? No, I'm Santa Claus! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>
<p>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>
<p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Bender, quit destroying the universe! Kids have names? Soothe us with sweet lies.</p>
<p>Leela's gonna kill me. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
<p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. I'll get my kit!</p>
<p>Ummm…to eBay? It must be wonderful. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
<p>Anyone who laughs is a communist! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
<p>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Actually, that's still true. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>
<p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
